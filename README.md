## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Business Analytics
Task 1 of the Internship was focused on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about video game sales. The dataset includes details like game rankings, names, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, and sales figures across different regions.

* Data Cleaning:
  - Handled missing values by dropping rows with missing values.
  - Outliers are detected and removed from the dataset using a z-score.
* Descriptive Analysis:
  - I calculated summary statistics like the mean, median, minimm, maximum and quartiles to better understand the distribution of sales.
* Visualization
  - I plotted a Histograms to visualize the distribution of Global Sales..
  - And line plots to visualize the trends of sales over time.
* Segmentation and Profiling:
  - Segmentation by genre, and summary statistics are calculated for each genre to understand sales patterns within different genres.
* Correlation and Trends:
  - I calculated the correlation coefficients to better understand the relationship between different numerical variables.
  - I plotted a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.
* Tools
  - I used excel for basic data cleaning and analysis.
  - I utilized the Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy libraries in Python for in-depth analysis.
